# celastrina
Javascript Framework for simplifying Microsoft Azure Functions and supporting resources.

## Who should use celastrina.js?
Right now, to receive the highest time-to-value, celastrina.js should be used in green-field application development. 
While stable and well-supported, celastrina.js has not been out in the wild very long; because of this, configurations 
to support diverse deployments are not yet available. While extremely flexible and developer oriented, celastrina.js is
still fairly rigid to its intended framework, using it on established or legacy projects usually requires a lot of 
customization and code, potentially lowering your time-to-value.

## Prerequisite
1. You gotta know Azure, at least a little.
2. You gotta know Javascript and Node.js, duh.
